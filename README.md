# Romassist v3

Several components:
- Library `emuhost` for emulators to consume, so they all behave the same.
- Backend app with database, HTTP server, and process launcher intended to run as a systemd service.
- Frontend app for interacting with that.
- Web app, does the same as frontend but via HTTP.
