I want a fancy option to interactively merge two databases.
Main use case is I collect new games and annotate them primarily on my PC, and there's a Pi already provisioned with an older state of the same set.

One might expect the orchestration to live in Server, but I'm thinking Menu instead.
Server would involve adding a huge amount of state, and then like, what happens if the process is aborted?
And adding HTTP or WS endpoints for every little step of the operation... messy.
Problem with doing it in Menu is that we'll have to reimplement for Web.

Within Menu, neither of the databases is local.
That might actually make things simpler. We have two hosts to talk to, and they are symmetric.

## Main flow, from user's point of view.

- Settings/Network: Add an option "Sync".
- New modal to collect initial parameters:
- - Remote IP address and port.
- - Access: Read Only, Write Only, Read/Write. Default Read Only.
- - Add games? Y/N/Ask for both Remote and Local. (n/a if we have one-way access)
- - Delete games? ''
- - Add screencaps? ''
- - Add plays? ''
- - Add launchers? ''
- Show spinner and fast-updating text, which game is being looked at. Progress bar quantized by games.
- Interrupt with a new modal at any conflict:
- - This is a 2-way merge, not 3-way, so we generally don't know which side is newer.
- - Show all game fields, highlight discrepancies. "Use Remote", "Use Local", "Refine", "Skip", "Abort".
- - Retain the highlighted button. Typically the user will "Use Remote" dozens of times in a row.
- - "Refine" to allow editing each field individually, then we update both hosts (or just the writeable one).
- Modal changes to summary. Count of games modified, added, removed. And count of "other change" eg plays.

## TODO

- [ ] Back up data and roms.
- [ ] Stand a second ra3 instance on my PC with older data.
- [ ] Add UI for initiation.
- [ ] New service in Menu for orchestration.
